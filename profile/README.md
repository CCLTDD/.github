## Hi there 👋


🙋‍♀️ We are CCLTDD, a department of the CALICULT, a team that works on many different projects, including CALICODE. CALICODE is based on CALICO, a biannual competitive coding event. CALICODE is a platform to extend CALICO with more problems and more!

🌈 Please favorite our repos! No reason in particular...

👩‍💻 We will add more repos and features... soon... hopefully.

🍿 We worship the CALICO Bricks AND the god Big Ben.

🧙 CALICO has a cool discord! https://discord.gg/6bvzygFbKK
